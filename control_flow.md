# Python Conditions & Control Flow – Practical Questions  
**(Hands-on | Students must write Python code)**

Based on the concepts shown in the code:
- `if`
- `if-else`
- `if-elif-else`
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`)
- Type conversion (`int()`, `str()`)
- `match-case`

---

## Section 1: Basic Conditions

### Question 1  
Write a program that checks whether a number entered by the user is **greater than 18** or not.

---

### Question 2  
Take a number from the user and print:
- `"Positive"` if the number is greater than 0  
- `"Negative"` if the number is less than 0  

---

### Question 3  
Ask the user to enter any value and check whether it is **True or False** using `bool()`.

---

---

## Section 2: if–else (Decision Making)

### Question 4  
Take user input for **age** and print:
- `"Eligible to Vote"` if age ≥ 18  
- `"Not Eligible"` otherwise  

---

### Question 5  
Ask the user to enter a number and check whether it is **even or odd**.

---

### Question 6  
Take marks from the user and print:
- `"Pass"` if marks ≥ 40  
- `"Fail"` otherwise  

---

---

## Section 3: if–elif–else (Multiple Conditions)

### Question 7  
Take age from the user and classify:
- Age 1–19 → `"Teen"`  
- Age 20–45 → `"Young"`  
- Age 46–120 → `"Old"`  
- Otherwise → `"Invalid Age"`  

---

### Question 8  
Take marks from the user and print grade:
- Marks ≥ 90 → `"A"`  
- Marks ≥ 75 → `"B"`  
- Marks ≥ 50 → `"C"`  
- Below 50 → `"Fail"`  

---

### Question 9  
Ask the user for **year of birth** and print the decade:
- 1900–1910 → `"10s"`  
- 1911–1920 → `"20s"`  
- 1921–1930 → `"30s"`  
- Otherwise → `"Invalid Year"`  

---

---

## Section 4: Logical Operators (`and`, `or`)

### Question 10  
Take **marks** and **attendance** from the user.  
Print `"Scholarship"` if:
- Marks > 75 **OR**
- Attendance > 90  

---

### Question 11  
Modify the above program to give `"Scholarship"` only if:
- Marks > 75 **AND**
- Attendance > 90  

---

### Question 12  
Check if a number is between **10 and 50** using logical operators.

---

---

## Section 5: match–case (Python 3.10+)

### Question 13  
Take a number (1–7) from the user and print the corresponding **day name** using `match-case`.

---

### Question 14  
Create a program using `match-case` that prints:
- `"Admin"` if input is `"admin"`
- `"User"` if input is `"user"`
- `"Guest"` for any other input  

---

### Question 15  
Use `match-case` to check a **menu option**:
- `"1"` → `"Add Student"`
- `"2"` → `"View Student"`
- `"3"` → `"Delete Student"`
- Default → `"Invalid Option"`

---

---

## Section 6: Input Validation & Practice

### Question 16  
Take age input and check if it is a **valid number between 1 and 120**.

---

### Question 17  
Ask the user for a password and check:
- If length ≥ 8 → `"Strong Password"`
- Else → `"Weak Password"`

---

### Question 18  
Take a username and check:
- If username is `"admin"` → `"Welcome Admin"`
- Else → `"Welcome User"`

---

---

## Section 7: Challenge Questions

### Question 19  
Create a program that checks whether a year is a **leap year** or not.

---

### Question 20  
Build a mini login system:
- Username must be `"admin"`
- Password must be `"1234"`
- Print `"Login Successful"` or `"Invalid Credentials"`

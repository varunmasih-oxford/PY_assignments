# Python Functions – Practice Questions (Based on Given Code)

These questions are created from the concepts shown in the provided code:
- Functions with no parameters
- Functions with parameters
- Positional arguments
- Named arguments
- Functions with return values
- Local vs global variables

---

## Part 1: Functions with No Parameters

### Question 1
Write a function named `add()` that adds two fixed numbers inside the function and prints their sum.

---

### Question 2
Call the `add()` function **three times** and observe the output.

---

### Question 3
What happens if a function has no parameters but uses variables defined inside it?

---

---

## Part 2: Functions with Parameters

### Question 4
Write a function `add(x, y)` that takes two parameters and prints their sum.

---

### Question 5
Call the `add(x, y)` function using **positional arguments**.

---

### Question 6
Call the same `add(x, y)` function with **different values** and print the result.

---

---

## Part 3: Named Arguments

### Question 7
Write a function `percentage(amount, percent)` that calculates percentage.

---

### Question 8
Call the `percentage()` function using **named arguments**, changing the order of arguments.

---

### Question 9
What is the advantage of using **named arguments** in a function call?

---

---

## Part 4: Functions with Return Value

### Question 10
Write a function that returns the **sum of two numbers** instead of printing it.

---

### Question 11
Store the returned value from the function in a variable and print it.

---

### Question 12
Use the returned value in another calculation (for example, multiply it by 2).

---

---

## Part 5: Scope of Variables

### Question 13
Create a global variable and a function that defines a local variable with the same name.  
Print both values and observe the result.

---

### Question 14
Why does the global variable value not change when a local variable inside the function has the same name?

---

---

## Part 6: Combined Practice

### Question 15
Write a function that:
1. takes two numbers as parameters  
2. returns their sum  
3. stores the returned value in a variable  
4. prints double of that value

# Python Strings & Lists – Practice Questions (Based on Given Code)

These questions are created using the concepts shown in the provided code:
- Strings vs Lists
- Indexing (single & nested)
- Lists as mutable data types
- List operations: update, insert, append, delete

---

## Part 1: Strings vs Lists

### Question 1

```python
batch324 = "khushi ishika anvit"
````

Explain the difference between accessing:

```python
batch324[0]
```

when `batch324` is:

* a string
* a list

---

---

## Part 2: List Indexing & Nested Indexing

### Question 4

Given the list:

```python
batch324 = ["khushi", "ishika", "anvit"]
```

---

### Question 7

### Question 9

Add the value `100` to the **end of the list** and print the list.

---

### Question 10

Delete the element at **index 2** from the list and print the final list.

---

---

## Part 4: Conceptual Questions

### Question 11

Why are **lists called mutable** in Python?
Explain with one example.

---

### Question 12

What will happen if you try to change a character in a string using indexing?

---

### Question 13

Write a program to print:

* the first element of a list
* the first character of that element

---

### Question 14

Given a list of strings, write a statement to access:

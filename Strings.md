# Python Strings & Lists – Practice Questions

These questions are based on the concepts shown in the given code:
- Strings (single, double, triple quotes)
- String indexing & slicing
- `len()` function
- Lists
- List indexing
- List modification (`update`, `insert`, `append`, `delete`)
- Basic `if–else` with strings


---

## Part 1: String Basics

### Question 1
Create a string using **single quotes** and print it.

---

### Question 2
Create a string using **double quotes** that contains a single quote (`'`) inside it.

---

### Question 3
Create a string using **single quotes** that contains a double quote (`"`) inside it.

---

### Question 4
Create a **multi-line string** using triple quotes and print it.

---

### Question 5
Write a program to print the **length of a string** using `len()`.

---

---

## Part 2: String Indexing & Slicing

### Question 6
Given a string:
```python
txt = "Python Programming"
````

Print:

* the first character
* the last character
* the character at index `6`

---

### Question 7

Using the same string, print:

* all characters from index `7` to the end
* all characters from the start up to index `6`

---

### Question 8

Write a program to print the **middle character** of a string.

---

### Question 9

Write a program that prints the **last character** of a string using:

* negative indexing
* `len()` function

---

---

## Part 3: Conditional Logic with Strings

### Question 10

Create two variables:

```python
status = "loggedin"
username = "admin"
```

If status is `"loggedin"`, print
`Welcome admin`
Otherwise, print
`Please login`

---

---

## Part 4: List Basics

### Question 11

Create a list of **5 student names** and print the first student.

---

### Question 12

Given a list:

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

Change the value `30` to `300` and print the list.

---

---

## Part 5: List Operations

### Question 13

Insert the value `25` at index `2` in a list and print the updated list.

---

### Question 14

Add a new element `100` to the **end of a list** using `append()`.

---

### Question 15

Delete the element at index `1` from a list using `del`.

---

---

## Part 6: Nested Indexing

### Question 16

Given the list:

```python
names = ["khushi", "ishika", "anvit"]
```

Print:

* the first name
* the second character of the first name

---

### Question 17

Write a program to print **each character** of a string using indexing.

---

### Question 18

Write a program that checks whether a string length is **greater than 10** and prints a message.
